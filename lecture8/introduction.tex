  \frametitle{Introduction}

  Model-Checking is a set of techniques to approach the verification
  of a system (e.g., a hardware circuit, a program, a protocol)
  \vfill
  It was proposed by Clarke-Emerson and Sifakis-Quine
  as a way of automatically prove properties of a system
  \vfill
  The authors received the Turing Award in 2007
  \vfill
  The idea of model-checking was in 
  contrast with the established ``philosophy'' at that time ($\sim$ 1980) 
  which was suggesting semi-automatic human-driven approaches: 
  MC is loved by industry because of this ``push-button'' characteristic
