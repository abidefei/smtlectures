  \begin{itemize}

  \item Incrementality: for free, as Congruence-Closure is already incremental

  \vfill\pause

  \item Backtrackability: backtracking one equality amounts to {\bf undo} 
                          all the operations done during Congruence-Closure.
			  (This means that backtracking is as expensive as
			  solving)

  \item Minimal \tconflicts: computing minimal conflicts in \Uf is theoretically
                             very hard (NP-complete). We'll an acceptable way to
			     compute them

  \vfill\pause

  \item Theory-Propagation: it amounts to track all unassigned equalities such
                            as $a=b$. If during some Union( $x$, $y$ ), $a$ 
			    and $b$ become equal (because for instance 
			    $a$ is in the class of $x$ and $b$ is in the class
			    of $y$), then propagate $a=b$
