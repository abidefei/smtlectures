  \frametitle{Final Remarks}

  We did not say how to handle negative \tatoms, such as $\neg( x - y \leq c )$.
  However it is easy to see that  $\quad\neg( x - y \leq c )\quad$ iff $\quad y  - x \leq - c - 1\quad$
  \vfill
  Each \tatom is associated to two edges $(x,y;c), (y,x;-c-1)$. However
  at most only one of the two is activated (depending if \tatom is pushed positively or
  negatively)
  \vfill
  \pause
  Simple bounds, such as $\quad x \leq c\quad$ or $\quad - x \leq c\quad$ can also be handled. It is
  sufficient to add a ``fake'' (and fresh) variable $Z$ (stands for ``zero''),
  and use $\quad x - Z \leq c\quad$ and $\quad Z - x \leq c\quad$ instead of the above

  Another algorithm that can be used instead of BF is the
  Floyd-Warshall
  \vfill
  FW has a complexity of $\theta(n^3)$, while BF of $O(nm)$
  (variations of BF have complexity $O(m + n \log n)$)
  \vfill
  FW however is useful as it is trivial to compute all
  theory propagations. In BF, theory propagations are tricky
  to discover
  \vfill
  FW is independent of $m$, the numeber of edges. FW is good
  for {\bf dense} problems, while is likely to be bad for
  {\bf sparse} ones

  \begin{enumerate}

    \item Prove that adding $\{ (I,x_1;0), \ldots, (I,x_n;0) \}$ to a graph
          free of negative cycles, does not introduce any negative cycle

    \vfill

    \item Let $G(V,E)$ be a graph, let $x,y \in V$, and suppose that
          a path $y \rightarrow \ldots \rightarrow x$ exists in $G$.
	  Are the following true or false ? (if false, show counterexamples)

    \vfill

    \begin{enumerate}[$(a)$]

      \item Adding an edge $(x,y;100)$ to $G$ never causes the creation of a negative cycle 

      \item Adding an edge $(x,y;-100)$ to $G$ always causes the creation of a negative cycle 

    \end{enumerate}

    \vfill

    \item Let $\babst{\mu}$ be a set of constraints of the form $x - y \leq c$. Let
          $\mu$ be a model. Let $\zeta(x) = \{ \mu(x) + \epsilon \}$, 
	  for some $\epsilon \in \mathbb{Z}$. Show that $\zeta$  is also a model

    \vfill

    \item Show that conflicts returned discovered with checkNegativeCycle
          are always minimal

    \vfill

    \item Prove Observation 2 using Farka's Lemma
