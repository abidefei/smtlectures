  The Lazy Approach for a theory \T is based on the tight integration of
  \begin{itemize}
    \item a CDCL \satsolver
    \item a \tsolver, a decision procedure for \T
  \end{itemize}
  \vfill
  \pause
  The \satsolver enumerates Boolean models $\babst{\mu}$
  \vfill
  The \tsolver checks the consistency of $\babst{\mu}$ in \T
  \vfill
  \pause
  For efficiency, it is desirable that the \tsolver
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Reasons incrementally (does not compute everything from scratch everytime)
    \item Backtracks efficiently
    \item Returns minimal conflicts
    \item Performs Theory-Propagation
  \end{itemize}
