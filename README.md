# smtlectures
A collection of slides of the SMT course I held at University of Milan in fall 2011.
Each directory contains a main.pdf, a precompiled document from my machine.
The opensmt software can be downloaded from the [opensmt github repo](https://github.com/bobosoft/opensmt).
Enjoy and share.
